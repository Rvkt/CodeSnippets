For enterprise Flutter applications, I generally prefer **Riverpod** as the primary state management solution, sometimes combined with **Bloc-style patterns** for complex business flows.

My preference is based on **scalability, testability, and team productivity**. Riverpod provides compile-time safety, avoids context-related issues, supports modular architecture, and scales well across multiple teams.

That said, I don’t treat state management as one-size-fits-all. I choose the approach based on the complexity of the feature, team familiarity, and long-term maintainability.
