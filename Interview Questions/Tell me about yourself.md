I’m a Flutter Developer with around 2.5 years of experience, currently working at Softmint Digital Private Limited. I focus on building scalable and production-ready mobile applications using Flutter and Dart.

In my current role, I’ve worked on multiple business applications involving API integration, state management using Provider, form validation, custom UI components, and performance optimization. I’ve also handled real-world features like payments, reports, bottom sheets, and complex user flows, while ensuring clean and maintainable code.

I collaborate closely with backend teams to integrate APIs and debug production issues, and I take ownership of features from development to deployment.

I’m now looking to grow in a role where I can work on larger applications, improve architectural decisions, and contribute more deeply to product quality and scalability.
